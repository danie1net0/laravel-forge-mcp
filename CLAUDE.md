# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel 12 application using PHP 8.2+ with a SQLite database by default. The application includes Laravel Telescope for debugging and monitoring, and uses Vite with Tailwind CSS 4 for frontend asset compilation.

### Language Standards

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **English only** for all code, comments, commit messages, documentation, and user-facing text. This includes:
- Commit messages (using Conventional Commits)
- Code comments and documentation
- Variable/function/class names
- Test descriptions
- API responses and error messages
- User interface text

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
composer setup
```
This runs the complete setup: installs dependencies, creates .env from .env.example, generates app key, runs migrations, installs npm packages, and builds assets.

### Running the Development Server
```bash
composer dev
```
This starts all development services concurrently (server, queue worker, log monitoring, and Vite). It uses concurrently to run:
- `php artisan serve` - Web server on http://localhost:8000
- `php artisan queue:listen` - Queue worker
- `php artisan pail` - Real-time log viewer
- `npm run dev` - Vite dev server with HMR

Alternatively, start services individually:
```bash
php artisan serve                  # Start web server only
php artisan queue:listen           # Start queue worker
php artisan pail                   # View logs
npm run dev                        # Start Vite dev server
```

### Testing
```bash
composer test                      # Run all tests
php artisan test                   # Run tests directly
php artisan test --filter TestName # Run specific test
```

Tests use SQLite in-memory database and have Telescope disabled for performance.

### Code Quality
```bash
./vendor/bin/pint                  # Fix code style (Laravel Pint)
./vendor/bin/pint --test           # Check code style without fixing
```

### Asset Building
```bash
npm run build                      # Build production assets
npm run dev                        # Start Vite dev server
```

### Database Operations
```bash
php artisan migrate                # Run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh          # Drop all tables and re-run migrations
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed   # Fresh migration with seeders
php artisan db:seed                # Run database seeders
```

### Laravel Telescope
Access Telescope at `/telescope` when the application is running. Telescope monitors:
- Requests, queries, models, jobs, events, logs
- Cache operations, Redis commands, client requests
- Exceptions, gates, notifications, mail

Configure Telescope behavior in `config/telescope.php` or via environment variables (TELESCOPE_*).

## Architecture

### Application Bootstrap
The application uses Laravel 12's streamlined bootstrap process in `bootstrap/app.php`:
- Routes defined in `routes/web.php` and `routes/console.php`
- Health check endpoint at `/up`
- Middleware and exception handling configured via fluent API

### Directory Structure
- `app/Http/Controllers/` - HTTP controllers
- `app/Models/` - Eloquent models
- `app/Providers/` - Service providers (AppServiceProvider, TelescopeServiceProvider)
- `database/migrations/` - Database migrations
- `database/factories/` - Model factories
- `database/seeders/` - Database seeders
- `resources/views/` - Blade templates
- `resources/css/` and `resources/js/` - Frontend assets
- `routes/` - Route definitions
- `tests/Feature/` and `tests/Unit/` - PHPUnit tests

### Database
Default configuration uses SQLite (`database/database.sqlite`). Connection can be changed via `DB_CONNECTION` environment variable. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

### Queue and Cache
- Queue driver: `database` (configurable via `QUEUE_CONNECTION`)
- Cache driver: `database` (configurable via `CACHE_STORE`)
- Session driver: `database`

### Frontend Stack
- Vite 7 for asset bundling
- Tailwind CSS 4 with Vite plugin
- Laravel Vite plugin for integration
- Entry points: `resources/css/app.css` and `resources/js/app.js`

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- `APP_KEY` - Generated by `php artisan key:generate`
- `DB_CONNECTION` - Default is `sqlite`
- `TELESCOPE_ENABLED` - Enable/disable Telescope (default: true)
- Queue, cache, session, and mail settings as needed

## Artisan Console

Common artisan commands:
```bash
php artisan list                   # List all commands
php artisan tinker                 # REPL for Laravel
php artisan make:controller Name   # Create controller
php artisan make:model Name -m     # Create model with migration
php artisan make:migration name    # Create migration
php artisan make:factory Name      # Create factory
php artisan make:seeder Name       # Create seeder
php artisan route:list             # List all routes
php artisan config:clear           # Clear config cache
php artisan cache:clear            # Clear application cache
```
## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT add Claude Code credits or "Generated with Claude" messages to commits.

Follow the Conventional Commits standard in English:

### Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <message>
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix

- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Configuration or build task changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependency changes
- `revert`: Reverting a previous commit

### Scope (optional)
Indicates the affected part of the code: module, component, or file.
Examples: `auth`, `dashboard`, `user`, `api`

### Message Rules
- Written in English
- Use imperative verbs (add, fix, implement)
- Be specific and concise
- Keep under 50 characters if possible
- No period at the end

### Examples
```

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.6
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/telescope (TELESCOPE) - v5
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(s). It is _always_ available through Laravel Herd.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== mcp/core rules ===

## Laravel MCP

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) is very new. You must use the `search-docs` tool to get documentation for how to write and test Laravel MCP servers, tools, resources, and prompts effectively.
- MCP servers need to be registered with a route or handle in `routes/ai.php`. Typically, they will be registered using `Mcp::web()` to register a HTTP streaming MCP server.
- Servers are very testable - use the `search-docs` tool to find testing instructions.
- Do not run `mcp:start`. This command hangs waiting for JSON RPC MCP requests.
- Some MCP clients use Node, which has its own certificate store. If a user tries to connect to their web MCP server locally using https://, it could fail due to this reason. They will need to switch to http:// during local development.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest v4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest v4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.


=== .ai/architecture rules ===

# Arquitetura - Essentials

## Princípios

- **Controllers magros** - apenas coordenam
- **Models focados** - lógica de domínio
- **Actions para negócio** - lógica complexa isolada
- **Services para externo** - APIs e integrações
- **DTOs com spatie/laravel-data** - sempre que instalado
- **Single Responsibility** - uma classe, uma responsabilidade

## Estrutura

```

├── Observers/            # Observers de models
└── Traits/               # Traits reutilizáveis
```

## Actions

**Quando usar:**
- Lógica de negócio complexa
- Operações multi-step
- Código reutilizável
- Múltiplos models envolvidos

**Nomenclatura:** `[Verbo][Substantivo]Action`

```php
class CreateSubscriptionAction
{
    public function __construct(
        private StripeService $stripe
    ) {}

    public function execute(User $user, Plan $plan): Subscription
    {
        $stripeSubscription = $this->stripe->createSubscription(
            $user->stripe_customer_id,
            $plan->stripe_price_id
        );

        $subscription = $user->subscriptions()->create([
            'plan_id' => $plan->id,
            'stripe_subscription_id' => $stripeSubscription->id,
            'status' => 'active',
        ]);

        event(new SubscriptionCreated($subscription));

        return $subscription;
    }
}
```

## Services

**Quando usar:**
- APIs externas (Stripe, AWS)
- Envio de emails
- Upload de arquivos
- Comunicação externa

```php
class StripeService
{
    private StripeClient $stripe;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->stripe = new StripeClient(config('services.stripe.secret'));
    }

    public function createSubscription(string $customerId, string $priceId)
    {
        return $this->stripe->subscriptions->create([
            'customer' => $customerId,
            'items' => [['price' => $priceId]],
        ]);
    }
}
```

## DTOs

**⚠️ IMPORTANTE:** Sempre use `spatie/laravel-data` quando instalado.

```php
use Spatie\LaravelData\Data;

class CreateSubscriptionData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $userId,
        public int $planId,
        public ?string $couponCode = null,
    ) {}
}

// Uso:
$data = CreateSubscriptionData::from($request->all());
```

## Enums

```php
enum SubscriptionStatus: string
{
    case Active = 'active';
    case Cancelled = 'cancelled';
    case Expired = 'expired';

    public function label(): string
    {
        return match($this) {
            self::Active => 'Ativa',
            self::Cancelled => 'Cancelada',
            self::Expired => 'Expirada',
        };
    }
}
```

## Jobs

```php
class SendWelcomeEmailJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, Queueable;

    public int $tries = 3;

    public function __construct(
        public User $user
    ) {}

    public function handle(): void
    {
        Mail::to($this->user->email)
            ->send(new WelcomeMail($this->user));
    }
}

// Dispatch:
SendWelcomeEmailJob::dispatch($user);
```

# API Resources - Essentials

## Quando Usar

✅ **SEMPRE use API Resources** para retornar dados JSON, exceto respostas muito simples.

## Criando Resources

```bash
php artisan make:resource UserResource
```

## Resource Básico

```php
class UserResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray(Request $request): array
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'name' => $this->name,
            'email' => $this->email,
            'created_at' => $this->created_at->toISOString(),
        ];
    }
}

// Uso:
return new UserResource($user);
return UserResource::collection($users);
```

## Atributos Condicionais

```php
public function toArray(Request $request): array
{
    return [
        'id' => $this->id,
        'name' => $this->name,

        // Apenas para admin
        'email_verified_at' => $this->when(
            $request->user()?->isAdmin(),
            $this->email_verified_at
        ),

        // Múltiplos campos sensíveis
        $this->mergeWhen($request->user()?->isAdmin(), [
            'last_login_at' => $this->last_login_at,
            'stripe_customer_id' => $this->stripe_customer_id,
        ]),
    ];
}
```

## Relacionamentos (Evita N+1)

```php
public function toArray(Request $request): array
{
    return [
        'id' => $this->id,
        'title' => $this->title,

        // Apenas se foi eager loaded
        'author' => UserResource::make($this->whenLoaded('user')),
        'comments' => CommentResource::collection($this->whenLoaded('comments')),

        // Contagens
        'comments_count' => $this->whenCounted('comments'),
    ];
}

// Controller:
$post->load(['user', 'comments']);
return new PostResource($post);
```

## Paginação

```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::paginate(15);
    return UserResource::collection($users);
}
```

## Boas Práticas

```php
✅ return new UserResource($user);
✅ Use whenLoaded() para relacionamentos
✅ Use whenCounted() para contagens
✅ Oculte dados sensíveis com when()

❌ return response()->json($user);
❌ 'posts' => $this->posts (causa N+1)
❌ Expor passwords, tokens
```


=== .ai/code-style rules ===

# Code Style - Essentials

## Padrões

- **PSR-12** - Padrão oficial PHP
- **Laravel Pint** - Formatação automática
- **PHPStan nível 5+** - Análise estática
- **Strict types** - Sempre declarar
- **Type hints** - Obrigatório em tudo

## Nomenclatura

**Classes:**
```php
UserController          // Controllers
CreateUserAction        // Actions
StripeService          // Services
CreateUserData         // DTOs
SubscriptionStatus     // Enums
```

**Métodos:**
```php
public function getUserById(int $id): User        // camelCase
public function createSubscription(): void        // verbos
public function isActive(): bool                  // predicados com 'is/has'
```

**Variáveis:**
```php
$userId = 1;              // camelCase
$stripeCustomerId = ''; // descritivo
```

## Type Safety

**Sempre usar:**
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Actions;

class CreateUserAction
{
    public function execute(CreateUserData $data): User
    {
        return User::create([
            'name' => $data->name,
            'email' => $data->email,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Early Returns

**Preferir:**
```php
public function store(Request $request): Response
{
    if (!auth()->check()) {
        return redirect()->route('login');
    }

    if (!$request->has('email')) {
        return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'Required']);
    }

    $user = $this->createUser($request->validated());

    return redirect()->route('users.show', $user);
}
```

**Evitar:**
```php
public function store(Request $request): Response
{
    if (auth()->check()) {
        if ($request->has('email')) {
            $user = $this->createUser($request->validated());
            return redirect()->route('users.show', $user);
        } else {
            return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'Required']);
        }
    } else {
        return redirect()->route('login');
    }
}
```

## Named Arguments

```php
// Usar quando melhora legibilidade
$subscription = $service->create(
    customerId: $user->stripe_id,
    priceId: $plan->stripe_price,
    quantity: 1
);
```

## Imports

**Organizar:**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

// 1. PHP nativo
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;

// 2. Vendor
use Spatie\LaravelData\Data;

// 3. App
use App\Actions\CreateUserAction;
use App\Models\User;
```

## Arrays

**Preferir sintaxe curta:**
```php
$users = ['John', 'Jane'];  // ✅
$users = array('John', 'Jane');  // ❌

// Trailing comma em multiline
$data = [
    'name' => 'John',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',  // ← trailing comma
];
```

## Strings

**Usar aspas simples quando possível:**
```php
$name = 'John';           // ✅
$name = "John";           // ❌
$name = "Hello $user";    // ✅ (interpolação)
```

## Comparações

**Usar strict:**
```php
if ($status === 'active') {}     // ✅
if ($status == 'active') {}      // ❌

if (in_array($id, $ids, true)) {} // ✅
```

## Null Coalescing

```php
$name = $request->input('name') ?? 'Guest';

$user->name ??= 'Guest';  // Assign if null
```

## Métodos Estáticos

**Evitar quando possível. Preferir injeção:**
```php
// Preferir:
public function __construct(
    private StripeService $stripe
) {}

// Evitar:
StripeService::create();
```

## Comentários

**Apenas quando necessário:**
```php
// ❌ Óbvio
// Get user by ID
public function getUserById(int $id): User

// ✅ Útil
// Sync user with Stripe and update local status
public function syncWithStripe(User $user): void
```


=== .ai/validation rules ===

# Validação - Essentials

## Princípio Fundamental

**SEMPRE use Form Requests**, nunca validação inline no controller.

## Criando Form Requests

```bash
php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest
```

## Estrutura Básica

```php
class StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    // Omitir se não valida autorização
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return $this->user()->can('update', $this->route('post'));
    }

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
            'email' => ['required', 'email', 'unique:users'],
            'password' => ['required', 'string', 'min:8', 'confirmed'],
        ];
    }

    public function messages(): array
    {
        return [
            'name.required' => 'O nome é obrigatório.',
            'email.unique' => 'Este e-mail já está em uso.',
            'password.min' => 'A senha deve ter no mínimo :min caracteres.',
        ];
    }
}

// Controller:
public function store(StoreUserRequest $request)
{
    $user = User::create($request->validated());
    return redirect()->route('users.show', $user);
}
```

## Rules Comuns

```php
'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255']
'email' => ['required', 'email', 'unique:users']
'age' => ['integer', 'min:18', 'max:100']
'price' => ['numeric', 'decimal:2']
'active' => ['boolean']
'data' => ['array']
'file' => ['file', 'max:2048']
'image' => ['image', 'mimes:jpg,png']
'date' => ['date', 'after:today']

// Database
'email' => ['unique:users,email,' . $userId]  // Ignorar próprio registro
'plan_id' => ['exists:plans,id']

// Condicionais
'email' => ['required_if:type,email']
'phone' => ['required_without:email']
```

## Validação de Arrays

```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'products' => ['required', 'array', 'min:1'],
        'products.*.id' => ['required', 'exists:products,id'],
        'products.*.quantity' => ['required', 'integer', 'min:1'],
    ];
}
```

## Boas Práticas

```php
✅ StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest
✅ ['required', 'string', 'max:255']  // Array syntax
✅ Mensagens em português
✅ Omitir authorize() se não valida

❌ $request->validate() no controller
❌ 'required|string|max:255'  // String syntax
❌ authorize() { return true; }  // Desnecessário
```


=== .ai/tests rules ===

# Testes - Essentials

## Princípios

- **SEMPRE use Pest** (nunca PHPUnit direto)
- Mensagens **sempre em português**
- Expectations **sempre encadeadas**
- Models **sempre com factories**

## Regra #1: Expectations Encadeadas

```php
// ✅ Sempre:
expect($user)
    ->name->toBe('John')
    ->email->toBe('john@example.com')
    ->and($user->isActive())->toBeTrue();

// ❌ Nunca:
expect($user->name)->toBe('John');
expect($user->email)->toBe('john@example.com');
```

## Estrutura de Diretórios

Estrutura DEVE espelhar o código testado:

```
app/Models/User.php                     → tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
app/Services/PaymentService.php         → tests/Unit/Services/PaymentServiceTest.php
app/Actions/CreateUserAction.php        → tests/Unit/Actions/CreateUserActionTest.php
app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController → tests/Feature/Api/UserControllerTest.php
```

## Sintaxe Básica

```php
it('retorna uma resposta bem-sucedida', function () {
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertStatus(200);
});

test('usuário pode assinar um plano', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $plan = Plan::factory()->create();

    $this->actingAs($user)
        ->post('/subscribe', ['plan_id' => $plan->id])
        ->assertSuccessful();
});
```

## Expectations Comuns

```php
expect($value)
    ->toBeTrue()
    ->not->toBeNull()
    ->toBeGreaterThan(0);

expect($array)
    ->toHaveCount(5)
    ->toContain('item');

expect($string)
    ->toContain('substring')
    ->toStartWith('prefix');

// HTTP
$this->get('/api/users')
    ->assertSuccessful()
    ->assertJsonCount(10, 'data');

// Database
expect(User::count())->toBe(1);
$this->assertDatabaseHas('users', ['email' => 'test@example.com']);
```

## Boas Práticas

```php
✅ it('descrição clara em português')
✅ expect($user)->name->toBe('John')
✅ User::factory()->create()
✅ Arrange, Act, Assert

❌ it('funciona')
❌ Múltiplos expect() separados
❌ new User(['name' => 'John'])
```

=== .ai/models rules ===

# Models - Essentials

## Estrutura Base

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

class User extends Model
{
    // 1. Traits
    use HasFactory, SoftDeletes;

    // 2. Configuração
    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $primaryKey = 'id';

    // 3. Mass Assignment
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];

    protected $hidden = [
        'password',
        'remember_token',
    ];

    // 4. Casts
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
            'password' => 'hashed',
        ];
    }

    // 5. Relationships
    public function posts(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }

    // 6. Scopes
    public function scopeActive($query)
    {
        return $query->where('status', 'active');
    }

    // 7. Accessors/Mutators
    protected function name(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            get: fn ($value) => ucfirst($value),
        );
    }

    // 8. Business Logic
    public function isAdmin(): bool
    {
        return $this->role === 'admin';
    }
}
```

## Relationships

```php
// HasMany
public function posts(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
}

// BelongsTo
public function user(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
}

// BelongsToMany
public function roles(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class)
        ->withPivot('active')
        ->withTimestamps();
}

// HasOne
public function profile(): HasOne
{
    return $this->hasOne(Profile::class);
}

// MorphMany
public function comments(): MorphMany
{
    return $this->morphMany(Comment::class, 'commentable');
}
```

## Scopes

```php
// Query Scope
public function scopeActive($query)
{
    return $query->where('status', 'active');
}

// Uso:
User::active()->get();

// Scope com parâmetro
public function scopeOfType($query, string $type)
{
    return $query->where('type', $type);
}

// Uso:
User::ofType('premium')->get();
```

## Casts

```php
protected function casts(): array
{
    return [
        'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
        'settings' => 'array',
        'is_active' => 'boolean',
        'price' => 'decimal:2',
        'status' => SubscriptionStatus::class,  // Enum
    ];
}
```

## Accessors/Mutators

```php
// Accessor
protected function firstName(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
        get: fn ($value, $attributes) => explode(' ', $attributes['name'])[0],
    );
}

// Mutator
protected function password(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
        set: fn ($value) => Hash::make($value),
    );
}

// Ambos
protected function name(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
        get: fn ($value) => ucfirst($value),
        set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),
    );
}
```

## Query Builders Customizados

```php
// App/Models/Builders/UserBuilder.php
class UserBuilder extends Builder
{
    public function active(): self
    {
        return $this->where('status', 'active');
    }

    public function verified(): self
    {
        return $this->whereNotNull('email_verified_at');
    }
}

// Model
public function newEloquentBuilder($query): UserBuilder
{
    return new UserBuilder($query);
}

// Uso com type hints
User::query()->active()->verified()->get();
```

## Factories

```php
class UserFactory extends Factory
{
    public function definition(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => fake()->name(),
            'email' => fake()->unique()->safeEmail(),
            'password' => Hash::make('password'),
        ];
    }

    public function admin(): static
    {
        return $this->state([
            'role' => 'admin',
        ]);
    }
}

// Uso:
User::factory()->count(10)->create();
User::factory()->admin()->create();
```

## Performance

**Eager Loading:**
```php
// ✅ N+1 resolvido
$users = User::with('posts')->get();

// ✅ Nested
$users = User::with('posts.comments')->get();

// ✅ Conditional
$users = User::with(['posts' => fn($q) => $q->published()])->get();
```

**Select específico:**
```php
User::select('id', 'name', 'email')->get();
```

**Chunking:**
```php
User::chunk(100, function ($users) {
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        // Process
    }
});
```

## Observação

- Usar `fillable` (whitelist) ao invés de `guarded` (blacklist)
- Sempre type hint relationships
- Evitar lógica complexa em models
- Preferir Query Builders para queries complexas
- Usar Factories para testes
- Cuidado com N+1 (sempre usar `with()`)
